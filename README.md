# PyNEM
Python implementation of Nested Effects Models

# Consists of two primary parts:

- Classes:
	- Signal Graph: representing the graph over perturbed variables
	- Effect Attachments: mapping from perturbed variables (signals) to measured effect variables
	- Nested Effects Model: Uniting perturbation data, SignalGraph and EffectAttachments to facilitate prediction, scoring and learning

- Learning:
Submodule containing algorithms for learning Nested Effects Models
